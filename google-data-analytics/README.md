# C​ourse 1– Foundations: Data, Data, Everywhere
## Content
* **I​ntroducing data analytics**: Data helps us make decisions, in everyday life and in business. In this first part of the course, you will learn how data analysts use tools of their trade to inform those decisions. You will also get to know more about this course and the overall program expectations.
* **T​hinking analytically**: Data analysts balance many different roles in their work. In this part of the course, you will learn about some of these roles and the key skills that are required. You will also explore analytical thinking and how it relates to data-driven decision making.
* **E​xploring the wonderful world of data**: Data has its own life cycle, and data analysts use an analysis process that cuts across and leverages this life cycle. In this part of the course, you will learn about the data life cycle and data analysis process. They are both relevant to your work in this program and on the job as a future data analyst. You will be introduced to applications that help guide data through the data analysis process.
* **S​etting up a data toolbox**: Spreadsheets, query languages, and data visualization tools are all a big part of a data analyst’s job. In this part of the course, you will learn the basic concepts to use them for data analysis. You will understand how they work through examples provided.
* **D​iscovering data career possibilities**: All kinds of businesses value the work that data analysts do. In this part of the course, you will examine different types of businesses and the jobs and tasks that analysts do for them. You will also learn how a Google Data Analytics Certificate will help you meet many of the requirements for a position with these organizations.
* **C​ompleting the Course Challenge**: At the end of this course, you will be able to put everything you have learned into perspective with the Course Challenge. The Course Challenge will ask you questions about the main concepts you have learned and then give you an opportunity to apply those concepts in two scenarios.

## Transforming data into insights
The six steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act

1. Ask questions and define the problem.
2. Prepare data by collecting and storing the information.
3. Process data by cleaning and checking the information.
4. Analyze data to find patterns, relationships, and trends.
5. Share data with your audience.
6. Act on the data and use the analysis results.

### Dimensions of data analytics

Three disciplines:
* Statistics: make a few important decisions under uncertainty. Important key: Rigor
* Machine Learning: want to automate, in other words, make many, many,
many decisions under uncertainty. Important key: Performance
* Analytics: want to know how many decisions you want to make before you begin. Important key: Speed

## Understanding data ecosystem

### Data ecosystems 
Data ecosystems are made up of various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data

### Data-driven decision making
no matter how valuable data-driven decision-making is, data alone will never be as powerful as data combined with human experience, observation, and sometimes even intuition. 

### Origins of the data analysis process

* Ask: Business Challenge/Objective/Question
* Prepare: Data generation, collection, storage, and data management
* Process: Data cleaning/data integrity
* Analyze: Data exploration, visualization, and analysis
* Share: Communicating and interpreting results 
* Act:  Putting your insights to work to solve the problem

#### SAS' iterative life cycle

An iterative life cycle was created by a company called SAS, a leading data analytics solutions provider. It can be used to produce repeatable, reliable, and predictive results: 

1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Explore
4. Model
5. Implement
6. Act
7. Evaluate
