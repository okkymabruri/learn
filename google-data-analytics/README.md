# Course 1 – Foundations: Data, Data, Everywhere
## Content
* **Introducing data analytics**: Data helps us make decisions, in everyday life and in business. In this first part of the course, you will learn how data analysts use tools of their trade to inform those decisions. You will also get to know more about this course and the overall program expectations.
* **Thinking analytically**: Data analysts balance many different roles in their work. In this part of the course, you will learn about some of these roles and the key skills that are required. You will also explore analytical thinking and how it relates to data-driven decision making.
* **Exploring the wonderful world of data**: Data has its own life cycle, and data analysts use an analysis process that cuts across and leverages this life cycle. In this part of the course, you will learn about the data life cycle and data analysis process. They are both relevant to your work in this program and on the job as a future data analyst. You will be introduced to applications that help guide data through the data analysis process.
* **Setting up a data toolbox**: Spreadsheets, query languages, and data visualization tools are all a big part of a data analyst’s job. In this part of the course, you will learn the basic concepts to use them for data analysis. You will understand how they work through examples provided.
* **Discovering data career possibilities**: All kinds of businesses value the work that data analysts do. In this part of the course, you will examine different types of businesses and the jobs and tasks that analysts do for them. You will also learn how a Google Data Analytics Certificate will help you meet many of the requirements for a position with these organizations.
* **Completing the Course Challenge**: At the end of this course, you will be able to put everything you have learned into perspective with the Course Challenge. The Course Challenge will ask you questions about the main concepts you have learned and then give you an opportunity to apply those concepts in two scenarios.
## Introducing data analytics
### Transforming data into insights
The six steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act

1. Ask questions and define the problem.
2. Prepare data by collecting and storing the information.
3. Process data by cleaning and checking the information.
4. Analyze data to find patterns, relationships, and trends.
5. Share data with your audience.
6. Act on the data and use the analysis results.

#### Dimensions of data analytics

Three disciplines:
* Statistics: make a few important decisions under uncertainty. Important key: Rigor
* Machine Learning: want to automate, in other words, make many, many,
many decisions under uncertainty. Important key: Performance
* Analytics: want to know how many decisions you want to make before you begin. Important key: Speed

### Understanding data ecosystem

#### Data ecosystems 
Data ecosystems are made up of various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data

#### Data-driven decision making
no matter how valuable data-driven decision-making is, data alone will never be as powerful as data combined with human experience, observation, and sometimes even intuition. 

#### Origins of the data analysis process

* Ask: Business Challenge/Objective/Question
* Prepare: Data generation, collection, storage, and data management
* Process: Data cleaning/data integrity
* Analyze: Data exploration, visualization, and analysis
* Share: Communicating and interpreting results 
* Act:  Putting your insights to work to solve the problem


**EMC's data analysis life cycle**

EMC Corporation's data analytics life cycle is cyclical with six steps:

1. Discovery
2. Pre-processing data
3. Model planning
4. Model building
5. Communicate results
6. Operationalize

**SAS' iterative life cycle**

An iterative life cycle was created by a company called SAS, a leading data analytics solutions provider. It can be used to produce repeatable, reliable, and predictive results: 

1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Explore
4. Model
5. Implement
6. Act
7. Evaluate

**Project-based data analytics life cycle**

A project-based data analytics life cycle has five simple steps:

* Identifying the problem
* Designing data requirements
* Pre-processing data
* Data analysis
* Data visualizing

**Big data analytics life cycle**

Authors Thomas Erl, Wajid Khattak, and Paul Buhler proposed a big data analytics life cycle in their book, **Big Data Fundamentals: Concepts, Drivers & Techniques**. Their life cycle suggests phases divided into nine steps:

1. Business case evaluation
2. Data identification
3. Data acquisition and filtering
4. Data extraction
5. Data validation and cleaning 
6. Data aggregation and representation
8. Data analysis
9. Data visualization
10. Utilization of analysis results

**Data life cycle based on research**

One final data life cycle informed by Harvard University research has eight phases:

1. Generation
2. Collection
3. Processing
4. Storage 
5. Management
6. Analysis
7. Visualization
8. Interpretation

## Introducing analytical thinking
Analytical skills are qualities and characteristics associated with solving problems using facts. Five key skills in analytical thinking:

1. Curiosity: a desire to know more about something, asking the right questions
2. Understanding context: The analytical skill that has to do with how you group things into categories
3. Having a technical mindset: The analytical skill that involves breaking processes down into smaller steps and working with them in an orderly, logical way
4. Data design: Analytical skills that involve how you organize information
5. Data strategy: The analytical skill that involves managing the processes and tools used in data analysis

### Thinking about analytical thinking

Analytical thinking involves identifying and defining a problem and then solving it by using data in an organized, step-by-step manner

5 aspects of analytical thinking:
* Visualization
* Strategy
* Problem-orientation
* Correlation
* Big-picture and detail-oriented thinking

Questions data analysts ask when they're on the hunt for a solution.
* What is the root cause of a problem? Ask "why" 5 times
* Where are the gaps in our process?

Gap analysis lets you examine and evaluate how a process works currently in order to get where you want to be in the future. Businesses conduct gap analysis to do all kinds of things, such as improve a product or become more efficient.

The general approach to gap analysis is
understanding where you are now
compared to where you want to be. 

* What did we not consider before?
